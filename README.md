NFL MCP turns real NFL & fantasy data into a decisive edge — a suite of tools that plug
straight into your AI assistant (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, …). Ask a plain
question, get a data-backed answer: *who to draft, who to start, whether that trade is a
fleece, and what your playoff odds really are* — for **your** league, **your** roster,
**your** pick, in real time.

This isn't another rankings site you tab away from mid-draft. It lives **inside your
assistant** and answers the question you actually asked.

## 💬 See it in action

> **You:** *"I'm on the clock at 1.09 in my 12-team half-PPR draft — who do I take?"*
>
> **🏈 NFL MCP:** *Jahmyr Gibbs (RB) — top value here (VBD 8787), and there's a **value cliff at RB after him (−1995)**. Elite WRs are deeper, so lock the RB now and grab WR at the turn.*

> **You:** *"Start Puka Nacua or DeVonta Smith this week?"*
>
> **🏈 NFL MCP:** *Nacua — 18.7 projected (floor 11.6 / ceiling 25.8), ✅ high snap share, smash matchup. Start Nacua with confidence.*

> **You:** *"Is trading my Bijan for their CeeDee + a WR2 fair?"*
>
> **🏈 NFL MCP:** *Slightly favors you (fairness 82/100) — two startable pieces beat one stud for your thin WR room. ⚠️ You'd drop to 3 RB, so mind the depth.*

<sub>Real tool outputs — value cliffs, projections with floor/ceiling, market-value trade fairness — rendered by your assistant.</sub>

## 🔥 Why you'll win

**🎯 Draft day**
- **VBD draft board** ranked by *value over replacement* — the ordering that wins drafts, not raw ADP.
- **Live "war room"** — during your real ESPN draft it reads the board live and calls the best pick *for your roster*, with **value-cliff** warnings and **positional-run** alerts.
- **Rehearse first** — run 100 mock drafts from your slot before you're on the clock.

**📊 Every week**
- **Start/sit with automatic projections** — no manual point entry. `value × matchup × Vegas game-script × usage × injury`, with floor/ceiling and a transparent breakdown.
- **A real matchup edge** — which defense a player actually feasts on, from real weekly results (not a stale rankings page).
- **Streaming planner** — the best DST / K / QB / TE to stream over the next 1-3 weeks (soft defense, weak opposing offense, strong own offense).
- **Weather / wind** — fade passing and kickers in the ugly-weather games (wind ≥ 15 mph), dome games flagged neutral.

**🔄 Trades & waivers**
- **Trade analyzer on real market values** — knows your league's exact format and flags a lopsided deal *with evidence*.
- **FAAB bids** — exactly how much to spend on that waiver breakout (market value + league demand + your budget).

**🏆 Season strategy**
- **Monte-Carlo playoff odds** — *"72% to make it — 84% if you win this week."* Real probabilities, not vibes.
- **Strength of schedule** — rest-of-season and **playoff-week (15-17)** difficulty per position, for stash and trade-deadline calls.
- Opponent-weakness scouting — find the exploitable spot on the team you're facing.

## ✅ Why you can trust it

- **Real data, zero gut-feeling heuristics** — market-consensus values ([FantasyCalc](https://fantasycalc.com)), real weekly stats ([nflverse](https://github.com/nflverse)), your live league ([ESPN Fantasy](https://fantasy.espn.com)), news & injuries (ESPN), weather ([Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com)). **No paid API keys required to start** — connecting your own ESPN league needs a one-time cookie pull (see below), not a key.
- **Honest about uncertainty** — when it lacks live data it *says so* (and falls back transparently) instead of faking a confident call.
- **It grades its own accuracy.** A built-in backtest measures whether its projections actually beat a baseline on real past seasons, and a daily watchdog alerts if a data source changes. *Most fantasy tools never check whether they're right. This one does.*

## ⚡ 60-second start

```bash
docker run --rm -p 9000:9000 ghcr.io/gtonic/nfl_mcp:latest
```

Connect it to your assistant and ask about news, player values, projections, or run a
mock draft — no setup needed. For **your own ESPN league** (rosters, live drafts,
matchups, waivers), pull your ESPN session cookies once and pass them to the server:

```bash
uv run python scripts/espn_cookie_pull.py   # opens a real browser, log in, writes .env
docker run --rm -p 9000:9000 --env-file .env ghcr.io/gtonic/nfl_mcp:latest
```

Then just ask:

> *"My ESPN league id is `1234567` — build my draft board and simulate a draft from my slot."*

**Claude Code (CLI):**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport http nfl-mcp http://localhost:9000/mcp/
```

**Claude Desktop / Cursor** — bridge via [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote):

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nfl-mcp": { "command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://localhost:9000/mcp/"] }
  }
