# NFL MCP Server - AI/LLM Integration Guide

## Overview

The NFL MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server is a specialized FastMCP server designed to provide AI/LLM systems with comprehensive access to NFL and fantasy football data. This guide explains the MCP functionality, tool organization, and best practices for AI/LLM integration.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol that allows AI/LLM systems to interact with external tools and data sources in a structured, type-safe manner. This server implements MCP to expose NFL data through a consistent interface that AI systems can understand and utilize.

## Architecture

### Server Design

The NFL MCP Server follows a simplified, maintainable architecture:

- **Single Tool Registry**: All tools defined in one centralized location (`tool_registry.py`)
- **FastMCP Framework**: Built on FastMCP 3.0+ for robust MCP protocol support
- **HTTP Transport**: Runs on HTTP transport (default port 9000)
- **Database Caching**: SQLite-based persistence for optimal performance
- **Async/Await**: Fully asynchronous for efficient concurrent operations

### Core Components

1. **Tool Registry** (`tool_registry.py`): Central registration of all MCP tools
2. **NFL Tools** (`nfl_tools.py`): ESPN API integration for NFL data
3. **Sleeper Tools** (`sleeper_tools.py`): Fantasy league management via Sleeper API
4. **Athlete Tools** (`athlete_tools.py`): Player data management and caching
5. **Web Tools** (`web_tools.py`): URL crawling and content extraction
6. **Waiver Tools** (`waiver_tools.py`): Advanced waiver wire analysis
7. **Trade Analyzer** (`trade_analyzer_tools.py`): Trade evaluation and analysis

## Advanced Features

### Data Enrichment

The server provides multiple levels of data enrichment to enhance fantasy decision-making:

#### Basic Enrichment (Always Available)
- Player name resolution from IDs
- Team assignment and abbreviations
- Position information
- Basic statistics

#### Advanced Enrichment (NFL_MCP_ADVANCED_ENRICH=1)
- **Snap Percentages**: Offensive snap % for current week
  - `snap_pct`: Actual or estimated snap percentage
  - `snap_pct_source`: "cached" or "estimated"
  
- **Opponent Information**: Next opponent for defense units
  - `opponent`: Team abbreviation
  - `opponent_source`: "cached" or "fetched"

- **Practice Status**: Latest injury practice designation
  - `practice_status`: DNP, LP, FP, Full
  - `practice_status_date`: Date of practice report
  - `practice_status_age_hours`: Age of report
  - `practice_status_stale`: Boolean if older than 72h

- **Usage Metrics** (WR/RB/TE only): 3-week rolling averages
  - `targets_avg`: Average targets per game
  - `routes_avg`: Average routes run per game
  - `rz_touches_avg`: Average red zone touches per game
  - `snap_share_avg`: Average snap share percentage
  - `weeks_sample`: Number of weeks in sample (1-3)

- **Usage Trends**: Directional trend analysis
  - `targets`: Trend for targets (up/down/flat)
  - `routes`: Trend for routes (up/down/flat)
  - `snap_share`: Trend for snap percentage (up/down/flat)
  - `usage_trend_overall`: Overall trend direction

### Prefetch & Caching

Background data prefetching for optimal performance:

- **Enable**: Set `NFL_MCP_PREFETCH=1`
- **Interval**: `NFL_MCP_PREFETCH_INTERVAL` (default: 900 seconds = 15 min)
- **Athletes refresh**: `NFL_MCP_PREFETCH_ATHLETES` (default: on) every `NFL_MCP_PREFETCH_ATHLETES_INTERVAL` (default: 86400 seconds = daily)

The prefetch system automatically:
1. Determines the current NFL week via ESPN-core's scoreboard
2. Fetches team schedules (caches opponent data)
3. Fetches injury reports and (Thu-Sat) practice-status reports
4. Refreshes the athletes cache (player names/teams/positions) at startup and daily
5. Refreshes on configured intervals

Note: player-snap and usage-stat prefetching (Sleeper-sourced) were dropped in the
Sleeper-to-ESPN cutover (issue #52) with no ESPN replacement decided yet (ADR 0008);
`snap_pct`/`usage_last_3_weeks` enrichment still works from cached/estimated data.

### Robustness & Resilience

Many endpoints implement retry logic with snapshot fallback:

- **Retry Strategy**: Multiple attempts with exponential backoff
- **Snapshot Fallback**: Returns stale but usable data on failure
- **Metadata Fields**:
  - `retries_used`: Number of retry attempts
  - `stale`: Boolean indicating stale data
  - `failure_reason`: Last error code/category
  - `snapshot_fetched_at`: Timestamp of cached data
  - `snapshot_age_seconds`: Age of snapshot

Example response with snapshot:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "stale": true,
  "retries_used": 3,
  "failure_reason": "timeout",
  "snapshot_fetched_at": "2025-09-13T11:22:33Z",
  "snapshot_age_seconds": 642,
  "data": { ... }
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The server supports extensive configuration via environment variables:

- `NFL_MCP_TIMEOUT_CONNECT`: Connection timeout (default: 10.0 seconds)
- `NFL_MCP_NFL_NEWS_MAX`: Max news articles (default: 50)
- `NFL_MCP_SERVER_VERSION`: Server version string

#### Advanced Features

### Configuration Files

Alternative to environment variables, use YAML or JSON config files:

```yaml
timeout:
  total: 45.0
  connect: 15.0

limits:
  nfl_news_max: 75
  athletes_search_max: 150

rate_limits:
  default_requests_per_minute: 120

security:
  max_string_length: 2000
```

## Security Considerations

The server implements comprehensive security measures:

### Input Validation
- SQL injection pattern detection
- XSS injection pattern detection
- Command injection pattern detection
- Path traversal pattern detection
- Type checking and range validation

### Content Security
- HTML sanitization with script removal
- URL validation (HTTP/HTTPS only)
- Private network blocking
- Dangerous pattern detection

### Request Safety
- Configurable timeouts (30s total, 10s connect)
- Proper User-Agent headers
- No arbitrary code execution
- Parameterized SQL queries

### Rate Limiting
- Per-endpoint rate limiting
- Configurable limits and time windows
- In-memory storage (Redis recommended for production)

## Best Practices for AI/LLM Integration

### Tool Selection Guidelines

1. **Start with NFL State**: Call `get_nfl_state` to determine current week/season
2. **Use Aggregators**: `get_fantasy_context` reduces API calls for common data
3. **Cache Awareness**: `fetch_teams` and `fetch_athletes` are expensive; call once
4. **Enrichment Trade-offs**: Advanced enrichment provides better insights but uses more resources
5. **Strategic Tools**: Use strategic planning tools for multi-week analysis
6. **Waiver Intelligence**: Combine `get_waiver_log` and `check_re_entry_status` for comprehensive analysis

### Performance Optimization

1. **Prefetch**: Enable prefetch for frequently accessed data
2. **Caching**: Leverage database caching for repeat queries
3. **Batch Operations**: Use aggregator tools to reduce API calls
4. **Limits**: Set appropriate limits to balance completeness and speed
5. **Timeouts**: Adjust timeouts based on network conditions

### Error Handling

1. **Check `success` field**: Always verify operation success
2. **Handle stale data**: Check `stale` flag for degraded responses
3. **Retry logic**: Server handles retries automatically
4. **Snapshot awareness**: Use snapshot data when fresh data unavailable
5. **Error messages**: Parse `error` field for actionable information

### Workflow Patterns

#### Start/Sit Decision Workflow
1. `get_nfl_state` → Get current week
2. `get_team_injuries` → Check injury status
3. `get_matchups` → See weekly matchup (with enrichment)
4. `get_team_schedule` → Analyze opponent difficulty
5. Evaluate based on snap%, usage trends, practice status

#### Waiver Wire Research Workflow
1. `get_trending_players` → Identify popular adds/drops
2. `get_waiver_log` → Check league-specific activity
3. `check_re_entry_status` → Identify volatile players
4. `search_athletes` → Get detailed player info
5. `get_team_player_stats` → Verify fantasy relevance

#### Trade Evaluation Workflow
1. `get_rosters` → Understand team compositions
2. `get_matchups` → See current matchup context
3. `get_season_bye_week_coordination` → Check bye week impact
4. `analyze_trade` → Evaluate trade proposal
5. `get_strategic_matchup_preview` → Consider future schedule

#### Playoff Preparation Workflow
1. `get_playoff_preparation_plan` → Get comprehensive plan
2. `get_strategic_matchup_preview` → Analyze playoff weeks
