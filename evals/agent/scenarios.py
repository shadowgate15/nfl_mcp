"""Tool-routing scenarios for the agent eval.

Each scenario is a realistic user prompt plus the tool(s) a good assistant should
call. ``expect`` is an *any-of* list (several tools can be reasonable). ``args``
optionally asserts the model extracted an obvious argument — value ``None`` means
"just present".
