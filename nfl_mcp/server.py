NFL MCP Server - Simplified Architecture

A FastMCP server that provides:
- Health endpoint (non-MCP REST endpoint)
- URL crawling tool (MCP tool for web content extraction)
- NFL news tool (MCP tool for fetching latest NFL news from ESPN)
- NFL teams tool (MCP tool for fetching all NFL teams from ESPN)
- Athlete tools (MCP tools for fetching and looking up NFL athletes from Sleeper API)
- Sleeper API tools (MCP tools for comprehensive fantasy league management):
  - League information, rosters, users, matchups, playoffs
  - Transactions, traded picks, NFL state, trending players
- Waiver wire analysis tools (MCP tools for advanced fantasy football waiver management)
- ConfigManager integration for centralized configuration (Fix #1)
- ContextVar-based DI for database access (Fix #2)
- Extracted health endpoint (Fix #3)
