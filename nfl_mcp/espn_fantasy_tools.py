ESPN Fantasy tools.

Holds @handle_espn_auth_errors, the shared decorator every ESPN Fantasy tool
stacks under @handle_http_errors to turn missing credentials and 401/403
responses into a distinct, actionable error before the generic HTTP handler
sees them, plus `_fetch_espn_league_view`, the shared helper every
league-scoped tool uses to cross the pre-2018/2018+ URL-and-envelope
boundary (ADR 0003, ADR 0004; docs/ESPN_FANTASY_ENDPOINT_CATALOG.md §9)
without callers ever seeing it:

    @handle_espn_auth_errors
    async def get_espn_league(...): ...

`get_espn_league` is the first tool built on this foundation; later tickets
add the rest of the catalog (rosters, standings, matchups, draft,
transactions, free agents) as siblings in this module.
