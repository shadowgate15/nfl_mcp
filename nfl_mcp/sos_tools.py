"""Strength-of-schedule (SOS) tools.

Rank NFL teams by how easy or hard their upcoming — or fantasy-playoff-week
(15-17) — schedule is, per fantasy position, using defense-vs-position
rankings. Purely additive: this does NOT touch the projection engine. Useful
for rest-of-season planning, trade-deadline calls and playoff-week stash
decisions (which streamer / stash has the softest championship-run schedule).

Defense strength comes from ``matchup_tools`` (nflverse-derived: rank 1 =
toughest defense, 32 = easiest). Before a season has data (preseason) the prior
season is used as the strength prior; the response reports which season was used
and whether it fell back to placeholder data.
